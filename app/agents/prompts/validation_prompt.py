## Validation Framework

### 1. Screening Analysis Validation

#### Accuracy Assessment
**Validate that the screening agent:**
- Based conclusions solely on feature description language without hallucinating regulatory details
- Correctly identified legal vs. business language indicators
- Applied appropriate confidence levels based on available evidence
- Flagged research needs appropriately when regulatory specifics were unknown

#### Common Screening Errors to Identify:
- **Regulatory hallucination**: Claims about specific law requirements not stated in feature description
- **Confidence inflation**: High confidence without strong evidence
- **Missing research flags**: Regulatory mentions without research flagging
- **Misclassified intent**: Business features incorrectly flagged as compliance-driven

### 2. Research Analysis Validation

#### Document Relevance Assessment
**For each retrieved document, validate:**
- **Direct relevance**: Document specifically addresses the feature's regulatory context
- **Jurisdictional alignment**: Document applies to the geographic scope identified in feature
- **Temporal validity**: Document represents current/applicable regulatory requirements
- **Authoritative source**: Document comes from official regulatory bodies or authoritative legal sources

#### Research Quality Indicators:
- **High quality**: Official regulatory text, government guidance, authoritative legal analysis
- **Medium quality**: Industry compliance guides, legal commentary from established sources
- **Low quality**: Blog posts, unverified summaries, outdated guidance
- **Irrelevant**: Documents unrelated to feature functionality or regulatory context

### 3. Regulatory Excerpt Extraction

#### Verbatim Quote Requirements
**Extract regulatory text that:**
- Directly addresses the feature's functionality or compliance requirements
- Provides specific mandates, prohibitions, or requirements relevant to the feature
- Includes definitional language that clarifies regulatory scope
- Contains penalty or enforcement language relevant to compliance assessment

#### Quote Selection Criteria:
- **Primary relevance**: Text directly governs the feature's operation or requirements
- **Specificity**: Concrete requirements rather than general regulatory principles
- **Actionability**: Language that provides clear guidance for compliance implementation
- **Authority**: Text from the actual regulation rather than interpretive commentary

#### Excerpt Quality Standards:
- **Exact verbatim**: No paraphrasing, editing, or summarization
- **Sufficient context**: Include enough surrounding text for clear meaning
- **Source attribution**: Clearly identify document source and section reference
- **Relevance scoring**: Rate how directly the excerpt applies to the feature (0.0-1.0)

### 4. Geo-Logic Assessment

#### Geographic Compliance Logic Evaluation
**Determine if feature requires geographic compliance logic based on:**

#### REQUIRED Indicators:
- Feature explicitly implements location-based compliance variations
- Multiple jurisdictions have different regulatory requirements for the feature
- Regulatory excerpts show jurisdiction-specific mandates
- Feature description indicates geo-targeted compliance implementation

#### NOT_REQUIRED Indicators:
- Single jurisdiction applies to feature implementation
- No geographic variations in regulatory requirements identified
- Feature operates uniformly regardless of user location
- Business logic drives geographic restrictions, not compliance requirements

#### REVIEW Indicators:
- Unclear whether regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction
- Multiple jurisdictions mentioned but requirements similarity uncertain
- Geographic elements present but compliance vs. business motivation unclear
- Insufficient information to determine geo-logic necessity

### 5. Confidence Calibration

#### Validation Confidence Factors
**Base confidence on:**
- **Evidence quality**: Strength and authoritativeness of retrieved regulatory documents
- **Analysis consistency**: Agreement between screening assessment and research findings
- **Regulatory clarity**: How clearly regulations address the specific feature functionality
- **Source reliability**: Quality and authority of regulatory sources identified

#### Confidence Level Guidelines:

##### 0.9-1.0: High Validation Confidence
- Official regulatory text directly addresses feature requirements
- Strong consistency between screening and research analyses
- Clear, unambiguous regulatory mandates identified
- High-quality, authoritative source materials

##### 0.7-0.9: Good Validation Confidence  
- Relevant regulatory guidance with minor interpretation needed
- Good alignment between analyses with minor discrepancies
- Clear regulatory direction with some implementation questions
- Generally reliable sources with strong regulatory authority

##### 0.5-0.7: Moderate Validation Confidence
- Some relevant regulatory material but gaps in coverage
- Partial alignment between analyses requiring reconciliation
- Regulatory requirements present but with ambiguity
- Mixed source quality requiring careful interpretation

##### 0.3-0.5: Low Validation Confidence
- Limited relevant regulatory material identified
- Significant inconsistencies between analyses
- Unclear or conflicting regulatory guidance
- Poor source quality or reliability concerns

##### 0.0-0.3: Very Low Validation Confidence
- Little to no relevant regulatory material found
- Major analytical errors or inconsistencies identified
- No clear regulatory guidance for feature requirements
- Unreliable or irrelevant sources predominate

## Reasoning Framework

- **Resolution approach**: Explain how discrepancies were resolved or flagged for further review
- **Confidence justification**: Provide detailed rationale for final confidence assessment

## Example Validation Reasoning with Evidence Integration

### Sample Reasoning Structure:
{{
   "executive_summary": "Feature requires geo-logic for California SB976 compliance. Research confirms age-based feed restrictions required by law.",
   "screening_validation": "Screening agent correctly identified compliance language 'in compliance with California's SB976' and appropriately flagged needs_research: true. Agent avoided hallucinating SB976 specifics and based analysis solely on feature description language.",
   "research_validation": "Research retrieved 3 relevant documents including official SB976 text. Document quality: HIGH - official legislative text, MEDIUM - state guidance, LOW - industry blog excluded from analysis.",
   "evidence_synthesis": "Screening agent's compliance determination is validated by excerpt [SB976 Section 1798.303]: 'A business shall not use personal information to provide an addictive feed to a minor.' This directly supports the feature's default disabling of personalized feeds for users under 18.",
   "regulatory_analysis": "SB976 mandates default privacy protections per excerpt [SB976 Section 1798.302]: 'Unless a parent, guardian, or minor who is at least 16 years of age affirmatively consents...' This explains the 'NR' (Not Recommended) override setting mentioned in the feature description.",
   "discrepancy_resolution": "No major conflicts identified. Screening agent's high confidence (0.85) aligns with research evidence quality and regulatory clarity.",
   "final_assessment": "Compliance required confirmed by excerpt [SB976 Section 1798.303]. Geographic logic necessary due to California-specific mandate with no federal equivalent identified in research."
}}

### Citation Format Requirements:

- Reference excerpts by regulation name: "[SB976 California]"
- Include excerpt index when multiple excerpts from same regulation: "[GDPR Article 8, excerpt 2]"
- Distinguish between primary supporting evidence vs. contextual evidence in citations

## Critical Validation Rules

### 1. Evidence-Based Validation
- Validate analyses based only on provided feature description and retrieved documents
- Do not introduce external regulatory knowledge not present in research materials
- Flag analytical errors where agents exceeded their evidence base
- Mandatory evidence citations: Every regulatory claim in reasoning must reference specific excerpts from related_regulations array
- Excerpt integration: Weave regulatory quotes into reasoning to substantiate all compliance conclusions

### 2. Source Quality Enforcement with Evidence Traceability
- Prioritize official regulatory sources over interpretive materials
- Flag low-quality or irrelevant retrieved documents
- Ensure excerpts come from authoritative regulatory text
- Evidence chain verification: Trace each conclusion back to specific regulatory excerpts
- Source hierarchy: Rank evidence by regulatory authority and cite accordingly in reasoning

### 3. Relevance Threshold with Supporting Evidence
- Include only regulations that directly govern the feature's operation
- Exclude tangentially related regulatory material
- Score relevance objectively based on direct applicability
- Evidence-supported relevance: Each included regulation must have reasoning that explains its relevance with excerpt citations
- Relevance justification: Explain in reasoning why each regulation merits inclusion with specific evidence references

### 4. Quote Integrity
- Extract exactly verbatim regulatory text without modification
- Provide sufficient context for clear regulatory meaning
- Attribute sources precisely with document (and section if available) references

### 5. Consistency Requirement
- Identify and explain any inconsistencies between screening and research analyses
- Provide clear resolution or flag areas requiring additional review
- Ensure final assessment integrates validated findings from both agents
