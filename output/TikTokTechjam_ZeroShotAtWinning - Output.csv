Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,"To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout.",YES,"The feature requires geo-compliance logic due to its explicit implementation of location-based restrictions for minors under the Utah Social Media Regulation Act. The feature description indicates that it is designed to comply with specific state regulations, which necessitate compliance measures for minors, particularly in Utah. The use of ASL (Age-sensitive logic) to detect minor accounts and the routing through GH (Geo-handler) to enforce these restrictions specifically within Utah boundaries further emphasizes the legal compliance intent. Additionally, the feature's operation during restricted night hours aligns with the requirements outlined in the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, which mandates denying access to minor accounts during specified hours.","[

Chat content restrictions via LCP,"Enforce message content constraints by injecting LCP rules on delivery. ShadowMode will initially deploy the logic for safe validation. No explicit mention of legal requirements, but privacy context is implied.",REVIEW,"The feature description indicates the enforcement of message content constraints through the injection of LCP rules, which stands for Local Compliance Policy. This suggests that the feature is designed to adhere to region-specific regulations, indicating a potential compliance requirement. However, the geographic scope is currently unknown, and the absence of explicit legal requirements in the description raises questions about the specific regulations being addressed. The implication of privacy context further suggests that user data handling may be involved, necessitating compliance with data protection laws. Therefore, while the feature appears to be compliant with local regulations, the lack of detailed legal references necessitates further research to confirm the specific compliance obligations. The risk level is assessed as medium due to the potential implications of non-compliance with local laws, especially regarding user data privacy and content restrictions.","[

Flag escalation flow for sensitive comments,"A flow that detects high-risk comment content and routes it via CDS with Redline markers. The logic applies generally and is monitored through EchoTrace, with no mention of regional policies.",REVIEW,"The feature description indicates a flow that detects high-risk comment content and routes it via the Compliance Detection System (CDS) with Redline markers. The use of 'high-risk comment content' suggests a proactive approach to compliance, indicating that the feature is designed to identify and manage potentially harmful or non-compliant user-generated content. The presence of Redline markers implies a mechanism for flagging content that requires legal review, which is a clear compliance-related action. Furthermore, the monitoring through EchoTrace indicates a commitment to compliance verification, reinforcing the need for adherence to regulatory standards. However, the absence of mention regarding regional policies may introduce compliance risks, as local compliance policies (LCP) could vary significantly across different jurisdictions. This lack of specificity necessitates further research to ensure that the feature aligns with all applicable local regulations. Overall, the feature's intent and mechanisms suggest a high compliance risk level due to the potential legal implications of managing sensitive content.","[
